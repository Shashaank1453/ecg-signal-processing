## Introduction

ECG (Electrocardiography) is a medical technique used to record the electrical activity of the heart. This project provides a collection of scripts and tools to process and analyze raw ECG data, including filtering, peak detection, and feature extraction.

## Features

- **Noise Filtering**: Remove noise from raw ECG signals using various filtering techniques.
- **Peak Detection**: Detect R-peaks and other significant points in the ECG signal.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract important features like heart rate, RR intervals, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Plot ECG signals and extracted features for easy analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, resample signals, and normalize data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shashaank1453/ecg-signal-processing.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ecg-signal-processing
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Basic Example

To run the basic ECG processing pipeline:

```bash
python process_ecg.py --input data/raw_ecg.csv --output results/processed_ecg.csv
